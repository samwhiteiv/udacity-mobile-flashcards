## Overview 

This app was built as for the Udacity React Nanodegree Project 3: Mobile Flashcards. It is an app that helps a user study. For each subject you are studying, you create a deck. Each deck will contain questions or cards you want to asnwer. 

The app comprises of "Decks" containing "Cards". Each deck you create will contain questions (cards) for a particular subject (deck). For each card you create a question and an answer. 

Once you have a deck with cards, you can start a quiz to test your knowledge. As you go through the quiz, you will mark your answers as "Correct" or "Incorrect" via thumbs up/down buttons. At the end of your quiz you will get a score %. 

Notifications have been setup via expo and will remind the user to attempt one deck/quiz a day.
